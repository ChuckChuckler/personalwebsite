# Barney Chucklenut's Personal Website
I finally made a personal website!\
I AM AWARE that the loading time is a little long. PLEASE be patient! It WILL load eventually. I'm going to update this project with new animations soon, and I will work on fixing that, so PLEASE disregard it as of now, I beg!!!
\
\
This took an IMMENSE amount of effort animation-wise. As an estimate, about 90% of this project is animation and visual-design based.\
All those cool animations currently on the website took ~20 hours!!\
Still, I'm very proud of how they came out. They look really nice, especially since this is my first time going this in-depth with animations on my websites.\
All the art on the website is made by yours truly!\
This website should be fine on any device-- I incorporated a lot of responsive CSS.

## How to Use?
It's a personal website. Honestly, all you have to do as a user is scroll. PLEASE scroll I added some really awesome scroll animations PRETTY PLEASE!!!\
Honestly, there's no real "user manual" (once again, it's a personal website-- what is there to expect) but here's a list of some "fun features" I added:
- You can hover over my little "profile picture" on my about me section to see my Github and Discord usernames, or click on the picture to be redirected to my Github directly.
- If you hover over/tap one of the skills' icons, you can see its name
- Projects showcase! Use the left/right buttons to navigate! You can see the repos and demos to my not-very-impressive but nonetheless cool projects :-)

## Tools Used
This website is entirely made with static HTML/CSS/JS. Animations were made with a combo of plain JS and GSAP.

## Future Features
- Carousel animation on project showcase
- Cursor effect (trail of some kind?)
- Quicker load time
- Less choppy animation
- More random features that I come up with teehee
